You can count these calories by hand or this counter app will help you find out. It uses your phone's accelerometer (a.k.a. gravity or g-sensor) to measure your activity. We know that a human body can burn about 0 to 0.27 calories per pound per one minute of exercise so sensor data can be used to measure your activity and estimate how many calories you burn. It works like a very complicated pedometer that measures not only number of steps you make but also the amplitude and the intensity of your exercise. This is experimental feature but we work every day on improving its performance and accuracy. Some older devices may disable the gravity sensor when the screen is turned off. To solve this go to Settings > Display and set up screen timeout to never turn off then adjust brightness to minimum to save battery. ** Coming Soon ** This is a very new App it was released just in April 2012 and we are constantly adding new features which will include features like: - Counter of detailed nutrition facts for example content of Iron Calcium Magnesium Phosphorus Potassium Sodium Zinc Copper Fluoride Vitamins Caffeine Omega acids etc. in your diet- Keeping track of your weight- Keeping track of your exercise both in the app and on our WEB site... and more!

A value is assigned to every food and drink based on the amount of protein carbohydrate fat and fibre in the portion. Each individual has their own daily allowance based on their gender age weight height and lifestyle. The emphasis is on eating a healthy balanced diet and steady sustainable weight loss. Fresh fruit and vegetables have zero value and should be incorporated into your daily routine. This application enables you to calculate the value for any food based on the protein carbohydrate fat and fibre within the portion. It automatically calculates the value in your portion from the values entered into the on screen fields. Furthermore it gives you the freedom to test the value for any portion size based on a single set of nutritional data (for example per 100g). The application also allows you to save foods and their values to a personal 'Food List' saving you the trouble of re-calculating your favourite foods. In addition to this the application also comes with over 800 built in foods all searchable in real time. The Food Tracker allows you to plan and track your food entries as well as keeping track of your remaining daily and weekly points allowances. The tracker view also allows you to add any exercises or activities completed during the day and automatically adds the points gained to the overall weekly allowance count. Once the user statistics have been entered into the settings screen the application will automatically calculate the weekly allowance based on these settings. Dieting should form part of a healthy lifestyle incorporating exercise. The plan should not be undertaken by pregnant women or by anybody below the age of 17 without GP approval. Your goal weight should not be below the healthy weight range of BMI 20-25. NA";"database input,custom input,generic input,excercise,nutrition goals";"advices";"";"";"";"";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"NA"

Use Edibles to track and count calories 'wherever you are' right from your mobile phone. We know you are not always at your computer when enjoying a meal or snack. Edibles is the most reliable and intuitive calorie journal available for iPhone and iPod Touch. It comes with everything you need to achieve a healthy lifestyle. Makes food journaling FUN! - MacStudio If I can lose 40 pounds you can too! Download Edibles start losing poundage now! - iPhone Life Magazine Studies have shown that maintaining a diet journal while dieting can actually *double* your weight loss. Features include: - Tracks calories and automatically deducts it from configurable daily weekly and exercise pools. - Tracks exercise and automatically adds the calories you earn from your exercise to your exercise calorie pool. - Keeps a user-defined database of your favorite foods so that you never have to enter the same food twice. - Keeps daily entries as long as you choose to have them. - Built-in programmable calculator can be configured to calculate nutritional information. - Food categories allow you to track specific food types you want to be sure you eat daily. It does this automatically without having to manually choose Water Vegetables Fruit etc. - Automatically resets weekly allowances on a specific configured day. - Displays unused daily allowance as a badge on the application icon. - Keeps a chart of your weight and allows you to track your progress toward your goal. - Calculates and displays your BMI with other weight statistics such as current weight average lost total lost etc. - Fully supports metric and european units. - Does not force you to use a cluttered database full of foods that you never eat. Database is defined by you to include only the things you want. If you need to find a food Edibles includes the ability to search over 500000 foods and add them individually to your food list. (iPhone OS 3.x ONLY) - Automatically calculates your daily caloric needs. NOTE: It is possible to configure Edibles to track things other than calories such as carbs sodium etc but you can only track one item at a time (ie: ONLY calories or ONLY carbs... etc) What makes Edibles unique and better than other diet journals? Edibles is optimized around fast entry of log entries. Most diets track one particular thing as part of one's diet. Be it calories carbs sodium or whatever. Because Edibles tracks *only* calories it's UI isn't cluttered with extra bits of nutritional information that aren't useful to you. Edibles does not require an internet connection for day to day use. However when you combine Edibles with the free Edibles Online service you gain peace of mind knowing that your Edibles data is safe and secure. This is because Edibles has the ability to backup and restore all your foods and weights and up to 60 days of your log entries. Edibles Online even gives you the ability to enter your Edibles foods using your PC through the web! That means you don<U+0082><c4><f4>t need to spend all your time hunting and pecking on the iPhone keyboard. You can just go to Edibles Online and type it in! After downloading it's available in Edibles for you to use when you log your meals. Check out some of our reviews: It's simple to use...

With the help of a food and symptoms diary the medical professional you are consulting can narrow down the reasons for your symptoms. This means they can focus on the right follow-up (eg. H2 breath test) and thus reach an accurate diagnosis.The app can also be used after diagnosis. Different foods need to be tested to establish a person<U+0082><c4><f4>s individual tolerance level. Therefore keeping a symptoms or a food diary makes sense. The app is simple and intuitive. You can record your daily meals by entering them into the diary or simply taking a photo. You can also note your symptoms as well as the degree of severity and produce a clearly readable PDF which you can take to your doctor<U+0082><c4><f4>s appointment. Symptoms can also be recorded by taking a photo which is especially useful when you have symptoms such as rashes or other skin changes.Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)The app can also be used for recording the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn<U+0082><c4><f4>s disease.-----Questions or comments?-----This app has its own support forum at www.food-intolerance-network.com.

"Intolerance Food Diary Alder Agarik";"app";0;;1199;"Intolerance Food Diary,Alder Agarik";"twitter.com/AlderAgarik,twitter.com/AlderAgarik";"Health & Fitness,Health,paidServices,Android";0;;"doi.org/10.1186/s12937-018-0366-6";"NA Intolerance Food Diary is a simple way for you to record monitor and isolate your food intolerances food sensitivities and food allergies.The heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as Notes in to the diary. Entering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item symptom or note that you enter into the diary so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable. Once you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which after consumption may have either a short or a long incubation period before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health. The app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet. Paying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts and allows you access to the Backup/Restore Diary feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file move that file to a new device and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device. This app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. -- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary and to save them on your device in a specific IntoleranceFoodDiary folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts. All data entered into this app is stored locally on your device. It is only accessible by you.";"custom input,symptoms";"file,advices";"";"";"";"";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"twitter.com"

No matter how you choose to achieve your goal iSkinny will make the journey easier more efficient and a lot more interesting. Easy to use menus allow you to track your weight loss and your daily intake of food. You can change it to suit your particular journey with different units for weight daily intake etc. Anyone who is monitoring their weight knows it<U+0082><c4><f4>s not just about the food excercise is just as important. iSkinny allows you to track your exercise and take it into account in your daily statistics. iSkinny is extremely easy to use. It keeps note of how many units (this will depend on your settings for example calories) you are allowed a day and deducts from this letting you see how you are going throughout the day rather than realising at the end that you have overdone it! Another great feature is the favourites section. Most people especially those who are trying to lose weight have a number of core foods that they will tend to have every day or a few times a week. You add these to the favourites menu and can add it to your day in one click avoiding retyping it every day. Seeing your weight loss to date gives you the incentive to continue with it. Having iSkinny on your iPod or iPhone will give you the control and simplicity required to make you weight loss a success. Features: - Daily log for tracking your foods on a daily basis and maintaining a history of your progress - Fruit and Veg Milk and Dairy Protein Water Exercise intake tracker - European American BMI calculators. - Home screen badge notification - Daily intake tracker for monitoring your fruit and veg etc... - Favorites section for easy one click logging - Weight tracker for keeping track of your weight - Graphical view of weight loss progress - Export feature for backing up any/all logs - Passcode lock to protect personal data - Support for imperial and metric units - Passcode lock to protect your data - All features included in purchase price (No additional in-app purchases like other apps) NA";"favorite eaten foods,custom input,excercise,bmi,food preferences,body weight";"allowance badge,reminders/notifications";"";"";"";"";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"sheepsmoo.com"

Manage your dietary glycemic index and glycemic load with this comprehensive and advanced GI Tracker. Finally a way to look up GI and GL values for nearly 8000 common foods *and* record them to a daily food log! Low GI Dieters LOVE Low GI Diet Tracker: A fabulous help if you are following a Low Glycaemic Index diet as it allows you to check all the foods which you buy or prepare. -- myhealthportal.co.uk Wonderful tool. It provides me with all I need to maintain a low carbohydrate lifestyle. Great App!!!!! I have been recently diagnosed with prediabetes and this app is really helping me plan menus to help me get the most from my diet... I love it. Glycemic Index is a measure of the impact of a food on your blood sugar / glucose levels. The higher the index value the more that food raises your blood sugar. Managing the GI of the foods you eat may be an important step in maintaining a healthy diet especially for prediabetics and people on low carb diets. With a few taps you can search through thousands of foods color-coded by high- medium- and low-GI ratings. Next select a serving size based on common servings (or select by weight -- grams ounces or pounds). This will bring up a convenient view of each food's GI glycemic load (a measure of the impact of your selected serving on blood sugar) net carbs (total carbs minus dietary fiber) and a macronutrient breakdown pie chart. You can quickly 'log' this food as eaten. The food log feature allows you to see the average GI of all foods (a weighted average based on amount consumed) the total glycemic load of all the foods total net carbs total calories and a macronutrient breakdown. Plus quickly review the GI of each meal plus see a sum total of the each meal's average GI and total GL. HIGHLIGHTS - No frustrations design. It works like it should. - Search nearly 8000 common foods for Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load values. This database is twice the size of other apps' databases. - Graph your glycemic index averages and total glycemic load and net carbs. - Pick from many common serving sizes or select your own based on weight. - See GI GL net carbs and a macronutrient breakdown for each food. - Create your own custom foods and enter their GI and GL values. - Create a favorites list to easily access your commonly eaten foods. - Log foods to a handy daily food log. - View average GI for the day total GL net carbs calories macronutrients plus GI and GL for each meal.

The information is not advice and should not be treated as such.

Leave the calorie counting to us. Trainers love My Daily Plate for the export feature that emails your progress right to them and users love the positive focus on what you should eat rather than what you shouldn<U+0082><c4><f4>t. Both love the simple Today<U+0082><c4><f4>s Plate home screen which shows your daily goals and progress in one colorful glance. With this easy user-friendly app there is no typing no keyboard no data entry required. With a few simple taps you enter your food and track your success. We help you focus on the bigger picture of nutrition- eating the right portions of the right foods <U+0082><c4><ec>so that calorie maintenance naturally occurs. There are no categories for foods that fall outside of these groups (i.e. junk food) because those foods do not contribute to your daily requirements and overall nutrition goals which is what we<U+0082><c4><f4>re focused on. It<U+0082><c4><f4>s not only about what<U+0082><c4><f4>s healthy but how much. All too often people looking to eat right eat wrong erring on the side of too much protein too few fruits or out of proportion portions. With this app you can clearly and simply see whether or not you are eating enough fruits vegetables protein grains and dairy and can adjust your next meal accordingly. The rewards are both instant and long-term! Start thinking about what<U+0082><c4><f4>s significantly contributing to your nutritional needs rather than trying to track all the bad food you eat. Rather than feeling guilty about your bad choices each day feel proud of and track your good choices using the My Daily Plate app. My Daily Plate has four sections: TODAY<U+0082><c4><f4>S PLATE (My Plate)- Filling your plate at each meal is quick and easy. Just tap the food group item and quantity. - The plate clears itself at midnight so you can start fresh the next morning. - A healthy way to monitor everything you eat in the course of a day. - Enter the water you drink in your preferred unit of measurement but see equivalent amounts in other units. MY PROGRESS- Track your progress visually instead of deciphering lots of figures.- Check and see how you did the previous day.- Get an average of progress of the last 7 days.- Get an overall average of the recorded days since the date of your first entry. - View your daily average calories. HISTORY- Export your data to a CSV file (comma delimited) and send to your personal trainer or dietician.- Review your eating habits on a specific day. - Edit any existing entry.- Add a previous entry you forgot to make. SETTINGS- View the daily calorie goal recommended by the USDA based on your profile information.- Set your daily calorie goal based on your preference or personal trainer/dietician<U+0082><c4><f4>s guidance.- Set your preferred units of measurement for water intake.

The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a Ketogenic diet plan is the amount of carbohydrate and protein allowed on a daily basis. Keep in mind the Keto diet is not a 'fad' and has been medically researched for hundreds of years. If you are interested in the Atkins Diet or other low carb diets then this high fat moderate protein diet is perfect for you. It is one of the only LCHF (low carb high fat) diets that has significant scientific evidence backing it.Why Keto? Compared to the western diet which consists largely of highly-refined carbohydrates Ketosis the utilization of fat ketones instead of glucose can offer a lot of health advantages. Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight. However scientific research suggests that it goes further than that such as lowering your blood pressure risk for heart disease diabetes cancer stroke improving skin conditions and dental health mood stabilization and increasing energy levels. How MyKeto Helps You1. We quickly help you learn and become an expert in the LCHF Ketogenic diet.2. Our built in macro nutrient calculator will help you determine how many calories fats carbs and protein you should be consuming daily based on your body height weight activity level and gender.3. Quickly refer to the allowed/disallowed foods reference guide any time you need to see what you can eat in order to stay in a state of ketosis.4. Use the MyKeto Calorie and Carb daily tracker to completely manage your diet and stay on track5. Easily find recipes and meal ideas using our recipe feed and links *Daily MyKeto Calorie Counter Available as In-App Purchase*- Add foods from database or create your own custom presets- Add meals to your daily log and see a calculated breakdown of how many calories carbs fats and proteins you have remaining for the day.- Easily look at previous days to see what you ate- Synced online across all of your devices never lose your data.- *Internet Connection Required until offline mode is ready MyKeto Diet Guide Calculator & Calorie Tracking: -The Basics: Zero to Low Carb High Fat Moderate Protein-The Benefits: Backed by Scientific Studies-Dangers and Side-Effects of the Diet (yes a low carb keto state is not completely awesome)-Debunk Myths and Ease Concerns-How to Get Started-Allowed Food List-Not Allowed Food List-Tips To Staying On Track-Recommended Items-Fiber: Your Best Friend-Recipe Links-Live Recipe Feed Automatically Updated-Daily Calorie and Macro Ratio Calculator-Daily Calorie Carb Fat & Protein Tracker (In-App Purchase) This is a NO-BS reference guide and carb monitoring tracker for the Keto diet.

The main screen shows your current daily and/or weeks point total plus can be configured to show the amount remaining for the day based on your own personal target and you can also assign yourself a weekly 'bonus' amount of points too. Click the total(s) and you'll be shown a breakdown of all the recorded items that week. All weeks amounts are stored and are also available for review. You can also enter negative amounts for when you have been exercising. In addition to tracking your diet plan you can now also keep a track of your weight! This application does not come preloaded with the food/drink values used by well known plans. This is due to a number of reasons. The app will remember every item you enter and builds up a library of values based on your daily entries or you can add your own entries to the library. We've all been doing these schemes long enough to know what most things 'cost' haven't we? :-) So if you are expecting this app to tell you the value of items this is not the app for you if however you are looking for a quick and simple way to track what you have used then this IS the app for you! This application also comes with 3 widgets a subtle icon widget a 2x1 and 4x1 sized widget. These will display your daily and/or weekly total on your devices home screen. The 4x1 widget includes short-cut buttons to the Add screen and summary tables.

What happens if you go over your budget? How to rectify when you overindulge...

This simple photo diet tracking app lets you take a quick two-tap snapshot of your meal before opening your mouth. Even without a prescribed diet this awareness alone will result in fat-loss. But why? Research has confirmed that people who use food diaries lose three times as much weight as those who don't. But food diaries require time-consuming entries often written long after eating. Also according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison taking photographs of meals prior to eating is more effective than food diaries. The photographs acted as an instantaneous intervention and forced the subjects to consider their choice before the damage was done. One participant of this so-called flash diet said: I was less likely to have a jumbo bag of M&Ms. It curbed my choices. It didn't alter them completely but who wants to take a photo of a jumbo bag of M&Ms? The fastest way to correct a behavior is to be aware of it in real time not after the fact. --Tim Ferriss Download this free app now and start losing fat by tracking your Slow-Carb Diet<U+00AC><c6> meals and keeping record of your Four Hour Chef meals.
