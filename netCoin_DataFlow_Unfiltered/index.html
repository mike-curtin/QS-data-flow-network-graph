gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms? Then this app has been created for you. It is completely free without ads and in-app purchases. Bowelle allows you to easily keep a record of how you feel and track it over time. Additionally you can track food water intake stress levels bowel movements notes and custom fields you define. By keeping a journal you may learn significantly more about your patterns and possible triggers. Bowelle offers: A record of: <U+0082>G How you feel <U+0082>G What you eat <U+0082>G Water intake <U+0082>G Stress levels <U+0082>G Bowel movements <U+0082>G Notes <U+0082>G Up to 5 custom fields Charts <U+0082>G Visual representations allows you to determine how you feel over longer periods of time. Daily average <U+0082>G The daily averages are easily accessible from the side menu. <U+0082>G They are also configurable and can be based on the past 14 30 or 60 days. Alternatively you can base it on all existing data. Overview <U+0082>G Use the detailed overview to see all data. <U+0082>G Filter it by what you are interested in to narrow down the scope. <U+0082>G Export your data via email and share it with your doctor nutritionist or dietitian. Download Bowelle now and start keeping a journal today! --- A word from the developer It is stunning to read studies indicating that as many as 10-20% of the world<U+0082><c4><f4>s population have IBS. The symptoms can vary so considerably from individual to individual that one may wonder if it is even the same condition. I created Bowelle because there is a need for a fresh and modern approach in the marketplace. If you are reading this chances are that your symptoms are affecting your life more than you like. By keeping a record every day my hope is that you will identify some of the triggers causing your symptoms. If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to drop me a note at feedback@bowelle.com. I am developing Bowelle on my (limited) spare time but will listen to everything coming my way. - Robert Gummesson NA","Manual_In":"custom input,water,ibs symptoms,emotions,stress

You can count these calories by hand or this counter app will help you find out. It uses your phone's accelerometer (a.k.a. gravity or g-sensor) to measure your activity. We know that a human body can burn about 0 to 0.27 calories per pound per one minute of exercise so sensor data can be used to measure your activity and estimate how many calories you burn. It works like a very complicated pedometer that measures not only number of steps you make but also the amplitude and the intensity of your exercise. This is experimental feature but we work every day on improving its performance and accuracy. Some older devices may disable the gravity sensor when the screen is turned off. To solve this go to Settings > Display and set up screen timeout to never turn off then adjust brightness to minimum to save battery. ** Coming Soon ** This is a very new App it was released just in April 2012 and we are constantly adding new features which will include features like: - Counter of detailed nutrition facts for example content of Iron Calcium Magnesium Phosphorus Potassium Sodium Zinc Copper Fluoride Vitamins Caffeine Omega acids etc. in your diet- Keeping track of your weight- Keeping track of your exercise both in the app and on our WEB site... and more!

A value is assigned to every food and drink based on the amount of protein carbohydrate fat and fibre in the portion. Each individual has their own daily allowance based on their gender age weight height and lifestyle. The emphasis is on eating a healthy balanced diet and steady sustainable weight loss. Fresh fruit and vegetables have zero value and should be incorporated into your daily routine. This application enables you to calculate the value for any food based on the protein carbohydrate fat and fibre within the portion. It automatically calculates the value in your portion from the values entered into the on screen fields. Furthermore it gives you the freedom to test the value for any portion size based on a single set of nutritional data (for example per 100g). The application also allows you to save foods and their values to a personal 'Food List' saving you the trouble of re-calculating your favourite foods. In addition to this the application also comes with over 800 built in foods all searchable in real time. The Food Tracker allows you to plan and track your food entries as well as keeping track of your remaining daily and weekly points allowances. The tracker view also allows you to add any exercises or activities completed during the day and automatically adds the points gained to the overall weekly allowance count. Once the user statistics have been entered into the settings screen the application will automatically calculate the weekly allowance based on these settings. Dieting should form part of a healthy lifestyle incorporating exercise. The plan should not be undertaken by pregnant women or by anybody below the age of 17 without GP approval. Your goal weight should not be below the healthy weight range of BMI 20-25.

monitor and isolate your food intolerances food sensitivities and food allergies.The heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as Notes in to the diary. Entering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item symptom or note that you enter into the diary so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable. Once you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which after consumption may have either a short or a long incubation period before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health. The app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet. Paying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts and allows you access to the Backup/Restore Diary feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file move that file to a new device and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device. This app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. -- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary and to save them on your device in a specific IntoleranceFoodDiary folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts. All data entered into this app is stored locally on your device. It is only accessible by you.","Manual_In":"custom input,symptoms","Manual_Out":"file,advices","Automatic_In":null,"Automatic_Out":null,"Link_Out":null,"Link_In":null,"fastgreedy_order":null,"edgebetw_order":null,"cluster_fast_greedy":null,"cluster_edge_betweenness":null,"cluster_spinglass":null,"frequency":null,"KeysFirstRow":null,"KeyIncidence":null,"KeyRepetition":null,"KeyInPopular":null,"CentDegree":null,"CentClosens":null,"CentBetweens":null,"CentEigenvec":null,"tagSum":null,"fastgreedy_height":null,"edgebetw_height":null,"main_site":"twitter.com","PriceBin":"[0,1]","W_Out":"file,advices,NA","W_In":"custom input,symptoms,NA","Degree":3,"Closens":0.000984930562395351,"Betweens":60.333050382654,"Eigenvec":0.0567682715772864,"noShow":false},{"name":"ironman move x20","Category":"app-device","user_score":3,"precision":null,"rn":1201,"Synonyms":"ironman one gps+,ironman run x50,ironman","main_link":"global.timex.com/","tags":"Tracker,Activity sensor,Bluetooth,iOS,Windows,Android,OSX,In production","Price":0,"years_since_relevant":null,"DataSource":"https://doi.org/10.18710/QXMY88,http://vandrico.com/wearables","Description":"Fitness tracker with limited smartwatch functionalities","Manual_In":"physical activity,steps,energy expenditure,accelerometer,global positioning system","Manual_Out":"strava,rest api,api","Automatic_In":null,"Automatic_Out":null,"Link_Out":null,"Link_In":null,"fastgreedy_order":null,"edgebetw_order":null,"cluster_fast_greedy":null,"cluster_edge_betweenness":null,"cluster_spinglass":null,"frequency":null,"KeysFirstRow":null,"KeyIncidence":null,"KeyRepetition":null,"KeyInPopular":null,"CentDegree":null,"CentClosens":null,"CentBetweens":null,"CentEigenvec":null,"tagSum":null,"fastgreedy_height":null,"edgebetw_height":null,"main_site":"global.timex.com","PriceBin":"[0,1]","W_Out":"strava,rest api,api,NA","W_In":"physical activity,steps,energy expenditure,accelerometer,global positioning system,NA","Degree":7,"Closens":0.00100030009002701,"Betweens":256.143239631366,"Eigenvec":0.123119439804539,"noShow":false},{"name":"irythm zio xt patch","Category":"app-device","user_score":1,"precision":null,"rn":1202,"Synonyms":null,"main_link":"irhythmtech.com/products-services/zio-xt","tags":"Tracker,Heart rate,patch,Bluetooth,iPhone,In production","Price":0,"years_since_relevant":null,"DataSource":"https://doi.org/10.18710/QXMY88,http://vandrico.com/wearables","Description":"Wearable patch analyzing heart rate","Manual_In":"heart rate","Manual_Out":null,"Automatic_In":null,"Automatic_Out":null,"Link_Out":null,"Link_In":null,"fastgreedy_order":null,"edgebetw_order":null,"cluster_fast_greedy":null,"cluster_edge_betweenness":null,"cluster_spinglass":null,"frequency":null,"KeysFirstRow":null,"KeyIncidence":null,"KeyRepetition":null,"KeyInPopular":null,"CentDegree":null,"CentClosens":null,"CentBetweens":null,"CentEigenvec":null,"tagSum":null,"fastgreedy_height":null,"edgebetw_height":null,"main_site":"irhythmtech.com","PriceBin":"[0,1]","W_Out":"NA,NA","W_In":"heart rate,NA","Degree":1,"Closens":0.000966183574879227,"Betweens":0,"Eigenvec":0.0158808986440205,"noShow":false},{"name":"iskinny","Category":"app-device","user_score":0,"precision":null,"rn":1203,"Synonyms":"iskinny food diary and weight tracker,edward casey","main_link":"sheepsmoo.com/iskinny,sheepsmoo.com/iskinny","tags":"Health & Fitness,Motivation,Health,Physical activity,iOS","Price":0.79,"years_since_relevant":null,"DataSource":"doi.org/10.1186/s12937-018-0366-6","Description":"iSkinny is an invaluable weight loss tool.

You add these to the favourites menu and can add it to your day in one click avoiding retyping it every day. Seeing your weight loss to date gives you the incentive to continue with it.

Low GI Dieters LOVE Low GI Diet Tracker: A fabulous help if you are following a Low Glycaemic Index diet as it allows you to check all the foods which you buy or prepare. -- myhealthportal.co.uk Wonderful tool. It provides me with all I need to maintain a low carbohydrate lifestyle. Great App!!!!! I have been recently diagnosed with prediabetes and this app is really helping me plan menus to help me get the most from my diet... I love it. Glycemic Index is a measure of the impact of a food on your blood sugar / glucose levels. The higher the index value the more that food raises your blood sugar. Managing the GI of the foods you eat may be an important step in maintaining a healthy diet especially for prediabetics and people on low carb diets. With a few taps you can search through thousands of foods color-coded by high- medium- and low-GI ratings. Next select a serving size based on common servings (or select by weight -- grams ounces or pounds). This will bring up a convenient view of each food's GI glycemic load (a measure of the impact of your selected serving on blood sugar) net carbs (total carbs minus dietary fiber) and a macronutrient breakdown pie chart. You can quickly 'log' this food as eaten. The food log feature allows you to see the average GI of all foods (a weighted average based on amount consumed) the total glycemic load of all the foods total net carbs total calories and a macronutrient breakdown. Plus quickly review the GI of each meal plus see a sum total of the each meal's average GI and total GL. HIGHLIGHTS - No frustrations design. It works like it should. - Search nearly 8000 common foods for Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load values. This database is twice the size of other apps' databases. - Graph your glycemic index averages and total glycemic load and net carbs. - Pick from many common serving sizes or select your own based on weight. - See GI GL net carbs and a macronutrient breakdown for each food. - Create your own custom foods and enter their GI and GL values. - Create a favorites list to easily access your commonly eaten foods. - Log foods to a handy daily food log. - View average GI for the day total GL net carbs calories macronutrients plus GI and GL for each meal.

Both love the simple Today<U+0082><c4><f4>s Plate home screen which shows your daily goals and progress in one colorful glance. With this easy user-friendly app there is no typing no keyboard no data entry required. With a few simple taps you enter your food and track your success. We help you focus on the bigger picture of nutrition- eating the right portions of the right foods <U+0082><c4><ec>so that calorie maintenance naturally occurs. There are no categories for foods that fall outside of these groups (i.e. junk food) because those foods do not contribute to your daily requirements and overall nutrition goals which is what we<U+0082><c4><f4>re focused on. It<U+0082><c4><f4>s not only about what<U+0082><c4><f4>s healthy but how much. All too often people looking to eat right eat wrong erring on the side of too much protein too few fruits or out of proportion portions. With this app you can clearly and simply see whether or not you are eating enough fruits vegetables protein grains and dairy and can adjust your next meal accordingly. The rewards are both instant and long-term! Start thinking about what<U+0082><c4><f4>s significantly contributing to your nutritional needs rather than trying to track all the bad food you eat. Rather than feeling guilty about your bad choices each day feel proud of and track your good choices using the My Daily Plate app. My Daily Plate has four sections: TODAY<U+0082><c4><f4>S PLATE (My Plate)- Filling your plate at each meal is quick and easy.

MY PROGRESS- Track your progress visually instead of deciphering lots of figures.- Check and see how you did the previous day.- Get an average of progress of the last 7 days.- Get an overall average of the recorded days since the date of your first entry. - View your daily average calories. HISTORY- Export your data to a CSV file (comma delimited) and send to your personal trainer or dietician.- Review your eating habits on a specific day. - Edit any existing entry.- Add a previous entry you forgot to make. SETTINGS- View the daily calorie goal recommended by the USDA based on your profile information.- Set your daily calorie goal based on your preference or personal trainer/dietician<U+0082><c4><f4>s guidance.- Set your preferred units of measurement for water intake.

The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a Ketogenic diet plan is the amount of carbohydrate and protein allowed on a daily basis. Keep in mind the Keto diet is not a 'fad' and has been medically researched for hundreds of years. If you are interested in the Atkins Diet or other low carb diets then this high fat moderate protein diet is perfect for you. It is one of the only LCHF (low carb high fat) diets that has significant scientific evidence backing it.Why Keto? Compared to the western diet which consists largely of highly-refined carbohydrates Ketosis the utilization of fat ketones instead of glucose can offer a lot of health advantages. Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight. However scientific research suggests that it goes further than that such as lowering your blood pressure risk for heart disease diabetes cancer stroke improving skin conditions and dental health mood stabilization and increasing energy levels. How MyKeto Helps You1. We quickly help you learn and become an expert in the LCHF Ketogenic diet.2. Our built in macro nutrient calculator will help you determine how many calories fats carbs and protein you should be consuming daily based on your body height weight activity level and gender.3. Quickly refer to the allowed/disallowed foods reference guide any time you need to see what you can eat in order to stay in a state of ketosis.4.

This simple photo diet tracking app lets you take a quick two-tap snapshot of your meal before opening your mouth. Even without a prescribed diet this awareness alone will result in fat-loss. But why? Research has confirmed that people who use food diaries lose three times as much weight as those who don't. But food diaries require time-consuming entries often written long after eating. Also according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison taking photographs of meals prior to eating is more effective than food diaries. The photographs acted as an instantaneous intervention and forced the subjects to consider their choice before the damage was done. One participant of this so-called flash diet said: I was less likely to have a jumbo bag of M&Ms. It curbed my choices. It didn't alter them completely but who wants to take a photo of a jumbo bag of M&Ms? The fastest way to correct a behavior is to be aware of it in real time not after the fact. --Tim Ferriss Download this free app now and start losing fat by tracking your Slow-Carb Diet<U+00AC><c6> meals and keeping record of your Four Hour Chef meals.
